  Hi I'm Jessica and I'm just now starting to learn code. I've touched on design and design principles from my time in Marketing. However, due to my life as an Army spouse (and mountain of student debt), I need a career that is more flexible with our lifestyle and will support us financially.

  I'm taking on the challenge of coding. I'm starting with code academy, reading blod posts, watching videos, and literally doing whatever I possibly can to immerse myself into this oddly fascinating world. Overall, I'd like to secure some employment within a year. I'm not exactly sure what my best skills are but at the moment I'm gonna go guns blazing and try Full-Stack development. I'm sure it will be hard...

  BUT I know it will be worth it.
